# ShopApp

Shop simulation using Java console app

This app is created during Java SE 11 Complete Programming Course from Oracle.

It is the final version of code that I followed along while learning from the course.

Some intermediate changes are commented out and some are cleared out :grimacing:

This project uses advanced java concepts to implement the features.

IDE - Apache Netbeans

### To run the app, run ```Shop.java``` which contains the main method.
